### Create a User Profile Object

Write a script that will ask the user questions about themselves and store the information into an object.

1. Ask the user for their full name (first and last).
2. Ask the user for their birth year.
3. Ask the user for their top 3 favorite foods (comma separated).
4. Ask the user if they have a pet (yes/no).

Using these pieces of information:

1. Create an object using the object literal notation.
2. Extract the user's first name using two String methods and store it in the object.
3. Log the first name to the console.
4. Do the same with the user's last name and log it to the console.
5. Calculate the user's age and log it to the console.
6. Extract the comma separated list of favorite foods and store it into an array in the object.
7. Loop through the array to log the messages "I love [food]" for each item in the array.
8. If the user has a pet, log a positive message, otherwise tell them they should get one.
9. Log the object to the console. Note to not include anything else when logging: `console.log(object);`
